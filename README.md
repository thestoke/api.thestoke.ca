# The Stoke List

## Getting Started:

This section covers how to get the Stoke List API running locally. The workflow is optimized for contributors.

### Coding Style:

https://github.com/simonwex/javascript-style-guide

### Dependencies:

Make sure you have `nodejs`, `npm`, and `git` installed.

`gulp` is required to run the test suite and package client-side libraries with browserify. To install gulp on unix and OS X, run `sudo npm install gulp -g`.

### Environment Setup And Configuration

Install Node packages:

```
npm install
```

Configure your env:

```
cp sample.env .env

```

A short explanation of a complete `.env` file:

```
DATABASE_URL: The url, including credentials to access the db. This can be either mysql, postges or sqlite3
PORT: The port the server will run on
COOKIE_SECRET: The secret used to encrypt the cookie. You should change this to a string of your choosing
POSTMARK_KEY: Your Postmark API key
REDIS_PORT: Redis Server Port
REDIS_HOST: Redis Server Hostname
REDIS_DB: Redis DB
REDIS_PASS: Redis password
```

### Creating your Database

The sample.env includes details for sqlite3. If you have no opinion, stick with it for development.

Create your database by running:

```
./bin/migrate up
```

### Running the server

Process management is delegated to [Foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman). Go there, install it.

To actually run the service, run `foreman start` in the project directory.
